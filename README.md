# WGU Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree <br>Machine Learning for Customer Segmentation  
### By: Amanda Hanway, 1/8/2024 

## Introduction

This project utilizes real-life data provided by AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution concerning a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. 

Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. 

Task:  
Your job as a data scientist will be to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, you will also need to assess and clean the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.

View the code in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mandi1120/ml_customer_segmentation/blob/main/Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb).  

Note: The data files have not been included in this repository due to the terms and conditions established by Udacity and AZ Direct.
The files used throughout the project are described below:  
- Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv: Demographic data for the general population of Germany; 891,211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).  
- Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv: Demographic data for customers of a mail-order company; 191,652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).  
- Data_Dictionary.md: Information file about the features in the provided datasets.  
- AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv: Summary of feature attributes for demographic data.  
- Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook divided into sections and guidelines for completing the project. The notebook provides more details and tips than the outline given here.
